# HousingPrediction
Flatiron Online DataScience Mod 2 Project \r\n By : Steven Kyle

## Introduction/Abstract

The purpose of this project is to try and create a linear model for Housing Prices in King County. With this linear model we will be able to predict future housing prices. The features that are going to be used in this linear model will be discovered through EDA of an existing housing data set from King County.

### Main Questions

The main Questions that we are asking are:
1. Can we actually use a linear model to predict housing prices?
2. What features are important for evaluating a house?
3. How accurate can we get the model to be?
